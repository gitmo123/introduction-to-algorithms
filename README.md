## Introduction to Algorithms

This repository contains the algorithms described in [Introduction to
Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Second-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262032937).
This is an ongoing endeavor to implement them (at least) in python and C for
personal learning purposes.

## Contribution
If you like to contribute, fork away and add the algorithm in the language you
like. However I will accept python/C implementations only after I have
implemented it myself, so that I don't miss out on the learning experience.
